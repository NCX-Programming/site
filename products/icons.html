  <h1>Need a custom icon for your app? We've got you covered.</h1>
  <h2>Custom icons made just for your macOS or iOS app.</h2>
  <p>Standardized pricing available soon. Contact me (info below) to get an estimate.</p>
  <p>Most icons made are stylized for macOS/iOS. Ask about other design styles designed for other platforms.</p>

  <h1>Payment</h1>
  <p>I operate on a "don't pay if you don't want it" system. I'll keep working until I've made an icon you'd actually like to use for your program.<p>
  <p>While payment details aren't available right now, you're still able to purchase an icon from me by using the contact info below.</p>

<hr>
<p>I'm planning on having examples here and some other neat stuff but I'm good at icon design not web design.</p>
<p>So for now if you're interested, contact me on Discord, @NinjaCheetah#2861, or send an email to <a href="mailto:ninjacheetah@ncxprogramming.com">ninjacheetah@ncxprogramming.com</a>.
