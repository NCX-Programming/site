<h3>About</h3>
<p>RNGTool Plus is our cross-platform desktop port of <a href="/software/rngtool">RNGTool</a> and also allows you to generate random numbers through various customizable modes. It's written in Swift and uses <a href="https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui">SwiftCrossUI</a> to create a GTK+ 4 interface compatible with all desktop platforms. RNGTool Plus is currently in a much earlier state than RNGTool for Apple platforms, so expect missing or broken features to be improved upon in the future!</p>
<p><b>Modes currently included:</b></p>
<p><b>Number Mode:</b> Generate a single random number using only a minimum and maximum number. This is the simplest way to generate numbers.</p>
<p><b>Dice Mode:</b> Roll up to 6 6-sided dice, with dice icons to show your rolls.</p>
<p><b>Card Mode:</b> Draw up to 7 playing cards. You can optionally have the point values of each card displayed, with the Ace being either 1 or 11 points.</p>
<p><b>Marble Mode:</b> Generate up to 5 random letters using marbles. This is still a work in progress as shape drawing currently does not exist in SwiftCrossUI, so a list of letters is provided instead.</p>
