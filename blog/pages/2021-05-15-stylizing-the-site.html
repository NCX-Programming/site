    <p>So as you've probably noticed if you got this far on the site, we've finally added CSS. For a while (from the start of the website on January 29th, actually) it became a joke of sorts that this site had absolutely no styling. That was mainly because of how annoying CSS can be, and also how bad <a href="https://ninjacheetah.github.io">my other site that uses CSS looks.</a></p>
    <p>What started me off on making this site look better was some free time I had during school just yesterday. I decided to open GIMP and just see if I could create some sort of banner. It ended up coming out really good (in my opinion at least) so I added it to the website. From there, I decided to try and add the nav bar I used on my old site to this one, but this time actually make it look good. From there, I didn't like that the banner and nav bar used Sans-Serif but the body used Times New Roman, so more CSS it was! Eventually, with the help of <a href="../../members/ianskinner1982">IanSkinner1982</a>, we managed to get the banner and nav bar to stretch to the edges of the screen which greatly improved how it looked. All I did after that was add the GitHub and Discord link icons, and it was done! (also for the record I have no idea if this is in chronological order)</p>
    <p>I woke up this morning and had an idea: more banners! So I created banners for the <a href="../../programs/">Programs page<a> and the <a href="../../members/">Members page</a>, which both also came out pretty good (again, in my opinion at least). So for now, I think that just about wraps up our website "renovation". We will of course still add new things, but there shouldn't be any major changes coming soon.</p>
    <p>Sorry for the short article, but I felt like it would be better to at least say something about it than nothing.</p>
