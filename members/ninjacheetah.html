  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
  <p>Hi! I'm NinjaCheetah, a developer and the creator of NCX Programming. I make programs in C, and have made some programs in C# in the past. I'm a huge supporter of free and open source software, which is why everything I make it open source. I mostly use Linux for things like gaming, and macOS for development. Other than programming, I play a lot of video games and I do some 3D modeling from time to time.</p>
