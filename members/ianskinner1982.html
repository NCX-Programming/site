  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
  <p>Hello! I'm IanSkinner1982, the developer of <a href="https://github.com/IanSkinner1982?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=" target="_blank">a few C64 apps (in BASIC and assembly)</a> and a member of <a href="https://github.com/NCX-Programming">NCX-Programming</a>. I helped create some of this website, as well as <a href="/programs/ncxnewsplus">NCX-News+</a>. <br> I touch grass.</p>
  <h4>Facts:</h4>
  <p>The 1982 in my name comes from the year the Commodore 64 was released.</p>
  <p>I was <i>not</i> born in 1982. (a lot of people think that for some reason)</p>
  <p>The C64 is my favorite computer. (big surprise)</p>
  <h3>Stuff I've made</h3>
  <p>I'll put stuff here later, I'm just half asleep right now./p>
