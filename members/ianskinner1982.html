<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm IanSkinner1982, the developer of <a href="https://github.com/IanSkinner1982?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=" target="_blank">a few C64 apps (in BASIC and assembly)</a> and a member of <a href="https://github.com/NCX-Programming">NCX-Programming</a>. I helped create some of this website, as well as <a href="/programs/ncxnewsplus">NCX-News+</a>.<br><h4>Facts:</h4>The 1982 in my name comes from the year the Commodore 64 was released.<br>I was <i>not</i> born in 1982. (when my pfp wasn't my face, a lot of people thought that)<br>The C64 is my favorite computer. (big surprise)</p>
<h3>Stuff I've made</h3>
<p>Try my software with the emulator linked <a href="https://ianskinner1982.github.io/vice.js_files/tl64-nightly.html">here</a>. Please be patient as it is loading the disk about as slow as possible. I don't think I can speed it up.</p>
