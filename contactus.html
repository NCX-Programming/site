<h1>Contacting Us</h1>
<p>We have several options available if you'd like to get in touch with us.</p>
<h2>On GitHub</h2>
<p>Create an issue on a repo to address problems, or create a discussion (where applicable) to ask questions or make comments.</p>
<h2>By Email</h2>
<p>If you have anything you'd like to send to us directly then use our email, <a href="mailto:ncxprogrammingofficial@gmail.com">ncxprogrammingofficial@gmail.com</a>. We currently don't have a proper email on our domain (the address github@ncxprogramming.com just forwards to our Gmail address).
<h2>On Discord</h2>
<p>You can also join <a href="https://discord.gg/TbPXuFr">our Discord server</a> and ask questions or get support. Note that joining and participating in our server requires you to follow all of the rules in place there. We reserve the right to remove you at any time, with or without prior notice.</p>
