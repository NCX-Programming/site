    <h1 class="text-center">Contacting Us</h1>
    <p class="text-center">We have several options available if you'd like to get in touch with us.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">On GitHub</h2>
    <p>Create an issue on a repo to address problems, or create a discussion (where applicable) to ask questions or make comments. Our GitHub can be found <a href="https://github.com/NCX-Programming">here</a>, and can also be accessed using the GitHub logo at the bottom of every page.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">By Email</h2>
    <p>If you have anything you'd like to send to us directly then use our email, <a href="mailto:ncxprogrammingofficial@gmail.com">ncxprogrammingofficial@gmail.com</a>. We currently don't have a proper email on our domain (the address github@ncxprogramming.com just forwards to our Gmail address).
    <h2 class="text-center">On Discord</h2>
    <p>You can also join <a href="https://discord.gg/TbPXuFr">our Discord server</a> and ask questions or get support. Note that joining and participating in our server requires you to follow all of the rules in place there. We reserve the right to remove you at any time, with or without prior notice, if you are found to be in violation of our rules. The link to the server is also available through the Discord logo at the bottom of every page.</p>
    <h2 class="text-center">On Revolt</h2>
    <p>If you value FOSS like we do, you can join <a href="https://app.revolt.chat/invite/gHF7jcqa">our Revolt server</a> and ask questions or get support. This server is bridged to our Discord server so you won't miss out on anything. Note that joining and participating in our server requires you to follow all of the rules in place there. Just like with Discord, we reserve the right to remove you at any time, with or without prior notice, if you are found to be in violation of our rules.</p>
