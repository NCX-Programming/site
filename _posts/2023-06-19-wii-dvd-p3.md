I'm finally here again.

And this time, I have good news to share.

Those of you who have ever read the blog before have probably already seen the articles where I tried desperately to reveal the image of a DVD hidden from all of us in the Wii Menu's Disc Channel. You may also remember how both articles and the many attempts behind them were complete failures.

### So what was different for round three?
That's the painful part actually. Almost *nothing*. In fact, the only thing in my way was locating one little program and 6 bad bytes of data. Just <b>6.</b>

To start off my journey, I followed the same steps as I did two years ago. Grad a system menu 4.3U WAD, unpack it, unpack <code>00000001.app</code> from that, un-ASH <code>diskBann.ash</code> from <code>/00000001/layout/common/</code> using the mysterious <code>ASH.exe</code>, un-ARC the resulting <code>diskBann.ash.arc</code>, locate my target <code>brlyt</code> file and make the changes with <a href="https://github.com/HACKERCHANNEL/benzin">a better, newer version of Benzin</a>, and then it was time to face the challenge I had before. As things tend to go, it's a whole lot easier to take it apart than it is to put it back together.

One of the things I did differently this time was actually try and narrow down where the problem was. I did this by trying to re-pack everything in reverse order, so start by just repacking <code>00000001.app</code> with no changes. When that worked, I extracted the ASH file, made no changes, re-ASHed it, repacked <code>00000001.app</code>, and tried that. I kept going like that one step at a time until I discovered the point of failure. Surprisingly, that point of failure was actually my re-packed ARC file, <code>diskBann.ash.arc</code>. Even with no changes made to its contents, it was causing crashing.

### Wait.
You may have caught a key detail in that paragraph: I was able to actually recreate the <code>diskBann.ash</code> file. While I still would have had the issue I had this time eventually, attempts 1 and 2 had me stuck on the step of turning my <code>diskBann.ash.arc</code> into <code>diskBann.ash.arc.ash</code> (this should really just be a <code>.ash</code> but all of these programs just append the new extension to the end). The key ingredient here was <a href="https://gbatemp.net/download/ash-compressor.34055/">this program</a> that I managed to find on GBATemp, simply named <code>ashcompress.exe</code>. The source code is apparently lost to time but, get this, <i>it actually worked.</i>

With that big issue out of the way, I was able to very quickly discover another issue. Repacking <code>diskBann.ash.arc</code> from it's extracted state always resulted in a crash. I had yet again called on the mighty <a href="https://garhoogin.com/">Garhoogin</a> for help and we had spent this entire adventure in a VC together trying to figure what the heck was wrong. At one point, he mentioned possibly trying to compare the original ARC and my unmodified but re-packed version in a hex editor, to find any little thing that could be different. So I did.

That was it. 6 bytes. (And a row of <code>CC</code>s but according to <a href="https://wiibrew.org">WiiBrew</a> that's just padding and shouldn't matter.)

And with that, I all but shed a tear as I installed my WAD into Dolphin and watched the DVD I had longed to see for 2 and a half years spin into view.

There was just one problem.

The shadow and reflection were missing.

It turns out in my haste to try out this working version I had forgotten to check for other hidden elements in the Disc Channels layout file (despite <a href="https://tcrf.net/Wii#Disc_Channel_Banner_Files">The Cutting Room Floor saying this</a>. Nintendo also misspelled <code>DVDShade</code> as <code>DVDSahde</code> every single time, for some reason. I have no idea if it was necessary in the slightest but while I was setting the things I missed to be visible I took the liberty of fixing their typo nearly 2 decades after it was made. You're welcome, Nintendo.

The result was magnificent.

</div>

It was finally there, reflection and all. And I could rest easy, knowing I had finally completed my goal. In fact, I even took a nice screen recording so you can enjoy watching it spin when the banner first plays.

You may be wondering now, what exactly did I gain from this. Frankly, the answer is nothing. This was just dumb fun and was a good way to waste my evening/night. And hey, maybe I can automate this in the future to make matching the Disc Channel nice and easy! Or maybe I can find other patches that are easy to do to enable other random unused graphics. The possibilities are truly endless.

Thanks for coming along for the ride. I hope you've enjoyed the delayed but finally finished conclusion to this series. When I ended the last one with "hopefully there will be an update soon, as I intend to follow the plan above in the next few days so that I can make an update to this faster than last time.", I did not expect it to be well over two years later. Ah well.

That's all for now, but I hope to have some more content soon.
