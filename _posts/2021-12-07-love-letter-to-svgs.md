I finally reached that point in my life where I learned what an SVG is! Not sure how I made it this far without that knowledge.

If you don't know what vector graphics are, I suggest reading [Wikipedia - Scalable Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) first. To sum it up briefly, SVGs are made of geometric shapes instead of pixels so they can be easily scaled up without losing quality.

Currently I'm only making brand new images as SVGs, but I intend to remake some other old images, especially the banners on this site. If you have a really big monitor (or at least one that's really high res), you can really see this difference by visiting either [the homepage](/) or [the programs page](/software) and then [our icon sales page](/products/icons) _(hmm what could this be)_ and scroll down to the banner. Now, uh, I don't have a high-res screen (in fact my MacBook Pro is the last pre-Retina display) so I have no idea if this will work. But it probably should. Feel free to yell at me in an issue or something if this doesn't work.

That's all for now. Look forward to some scalable goodness in the near future.
