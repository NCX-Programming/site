<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>NCX-Core is an application that allows you to quickly download and update software by <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah">NinjaCheetah</a> and other small developers. It now has features such as NCX-News, which will tell you news about new programs that have been added or updated. It was the first major app I made and was the first program to be rewritten with a WPF GUI on top of .NET Core, and then later .NET 5.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the apps currently available (non-exhaustive):</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>You will need a 64-bit version of Windows 10 with the .NET 5.0 Runtime installed. (You can download that from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/">here</a>.)</p>
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>To install, download the latest MSI installer, using the link at the top of the page, and run in. Follow the instructions in the installer.</p>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>To compile, use the link at the top of the page to go to the GitHub page, and then clone/download the source code however you'd like. Once you have the source, the easiest way to compile it is to open the solution up in Visual Studio 2019, and then use the compile button.</p>
