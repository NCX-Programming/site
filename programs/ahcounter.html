<h3>About</h3>
<p>Ah Counter is a Discord bot made to count words said in Discord servers. Originally made for the Nintendo 3DS Homebrew group <a href="https://universal-team.net">Universal-Team</a>'s Discord server but was later open sourced and modified so that it could be configured and used by anyone.</p>
<p>By default, Ah Counter only watches for the word "Ah", but can somewhat easily be configured to count other words. Documentation on that can be found <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/AhCounter/wiki/Configuring-the-Bot">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Since Ah Counter is a standard Python Discord bot, it can be run with simply <code>python3 bot.py</code>.</p>
<p>You must configure the bot before trying to run it.</p>
