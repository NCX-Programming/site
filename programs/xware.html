<h3>About</h3>
<p>XWare is our small programs that can be downloaded in NCX-Core and are meant to interact with it in some way.</p>
<h3>How do I install XWare programs?</h3>
<p><u>Method 1 (Recommended)</u></p>
<p>Go to the XWare page in NCX-Core, choose a program, and click the download button. It will be automatically installed by NCX-Core.</p>

<p>You can also download the .zip archive for a given program (either from the top of the page or from GitHub) and extract it.</p>
<h3>Available Programs</h3>
