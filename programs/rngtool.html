<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>RNGTool is a macOS app used to generate random numbers. It supports multiple modes so that you can use it for multiple purposes.</p>
<p><b>Modes currently included:</b></p>
<p>Number Mode: Generate a single random number using only a minimum and maximum number. The simplest way to generate numbers.</p>
<p>Dice Mode: Generate up to 6 random numbers using dice with 6-20 sides. Now featuring dice icons showing your rolls when using 6-sided dice.</p>
<p>Card Mode: Generate up to 7 random numbers using cards. You can display the numbers, cards drawn, and the point values of them. Will output the cards as either only numbers (1-13), or including face cards (Ace, 1-10, Jack, Queen, King). </p>
<p>Marble Mode: Generate up to 5 random letters using marbles. Marbles with the letters on them are created automatically when you press generate.</p>
