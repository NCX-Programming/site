<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>theVaultBASIC2.0 is a collection of C64 apps written in BASIC ( possibly compatible with multiple other Commodore computers). They are a combination of simple games, utilites, and example/demo programs, all of which are stolen from theVaultC.  </p>
<h3>What's included?</h3>
<p>There are currently 6 programs:</p>
<p>GraphicStuffC, GuessMyNumberC, UnixTime, RainbowType, RNGTool, and WordGenerator</p>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>I'm too lazy to copy and paste the instructions, so look <a href="https://github.com/NCX-Programming/theVaultBASIC2.0#running">here</a>.
