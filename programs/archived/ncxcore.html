<h3>About</h3>
<p>NCX-Core is an application that allows you to quickly download and update software by <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah">NinjaCheetah</a> and other small developers. It now has features such as NCX-News, which will tell you news about new programs that have been added or updated. It was the first major app I made and was the first program to be rewritten with a WPF GUI on top of .NET Core, and then later .NET 5.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>NCX-Core gets its applications from our store JSON file, simply named "XStore". That file is hosted <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/ncx-core-files">here</a>, and if you'd like to request an addition or change, feel free to open an issue there.</p>
